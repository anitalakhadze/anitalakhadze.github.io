My name is Ani Talakhadze. But a few years ago, everyone started calling me Anita, so now it sounds even more natural and familiar than my birth name. 

I am a Java Software Engineer. I happen to love

- Researching tech topics
- Sharing my knowledge and experience
- Learning from others' experiences
- Writing blogs

Pretty good combo, right?

### Hi there!

My name is Anita. I'm a full-stack web developer with experience in a range of different projects. 
 
I can create **Angular** UI for an existing back-end API, build back-end APIs using **Spring Boot** or **FastAPI**, use **Firebase** for deploying UI, and quickly deploy _dockerized_ containers with **Gcloud Run**.

In addition to my development work, I've also created a tutorial series on Spring Boot that's available on Medium or in the blogs section [here](https://anitalakhadze.github.io/). I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge with others and helping them to learn and grow as developers.

Some of the projects I've worked on include **_Invoice Box_**, an electronic portal for issuing and monitoring invoices with Angular, and an **_enterprise billing platform_** for an international energy provider company. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to build amazing things with code.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope we have a chance to work together in the future!
